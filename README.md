# GHTM-Graph-based-Hybrid-Topic-Modeling

This repo contains the work behind the paper:  
**GHTM: A Graph-based Hybrid Topic Modeling Approach in Low-Resource Bengali Language**

---

## üìå Overview

GHTM model consists of three stages:

- **Text Feature Extraction**: using a combination of TF-IDF and GloVe representations.
- **Graph Construction & GCN**: a graph is built from the extracted vectors, which is processed by a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to produce similarity-aware embeddings.
- **Matrix Factorization**: applied to the embeddings to generate diverse and coherent topic keywords.

This hybrid approach helps GHTM uncover coherent, structure-aware latent topics.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kya602/GHTM-Graph-based-Hybrid-Topic-Modeling.git
cd GHTM-Graph-based-Hybrid-Topic-Modeling
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìÅ Prepare Data

Run the following notebook to prepare data:

```bash
jupyter notebook GHTM/Data\ Preparation.ipynb
```

This is a reference notebook for preprocessing and preparing data.

## üì¶ Models and Files Placement

- Download the GloVe models for Bangla from:  
  üîó https://github.com/sagorbrur/GloVe-Bengali

- Place the model file inside the following directory:

```
GHTM/model/
```

Make sure the path matches what‚Äôs expected in the notebook.

## üöÄ Train the Model

To train the topic model and generate topic words, run:

```bash
jupyter notebook GHTM/GHTM.ipynb
```

This notebook shows:
- How to train the model for topic modeling.
- How to evaluate the model and extract topic keywords.
